* Tasty SUGAR -  Search Using Golden Answer References

  The ~tasty-sugar~ package extends the tasty testing framework with
  the ability to generate tests based on golden answer files found for
  specific inputs.  Multiple answers may be specified with different
  parameterization, and there can be associated files that are
  presented to the test as well.

  The primary use of tasty-sugar is to generate test cases based on
  the contents of a directory, where the presence of various files
  determine which tests are generated.

** Elements of tasty-sugar:

    * Tasty.Sugar.CUBE :: Configuration Using Base Expectations

         Describes the configuration for tasty-sugar tests, including
         where they are located and what syntax the files should have.

    * Tasty.Sugar.Sweets :: Specifications With Existing Expected Testing Samples

         The tasty-sugar library uses one or more CUBE's to generate a
         set of test configurations based on the existing files found,
         outputting a list of Sweets representing the existing test
         data.

#     * KWQ: something to generate the tests
#     * KWQ: name of the test runner to show the tests
#     * KWQ: a test runner or option to write new outputs

* How to use tasty-sugar

  Full information on tasty-sugar features and capabilities will be
  provided in a later [[id:de026768-f805-4d30-8299-522cdd70926b][Detailed Information]] section, but this is a
  quick introduction describing various testing use cases and how
  tasty-sugar can be used in those use cases.

  For these motivational use cases, the example scenario basis is that
  the target to be tested is a tool to parse binary ELF files and
  generate various output information about those files (e.g. similar
  to objdump, but in a Haskell library form).

** Single Expected Output per Test

  * Scenario :: When running a test, it generates output that should
                be compared to the expected data maintained in a file.
                There is a simple, single expected output for each
                test, and no inputs other than the test name.

  For the example scenario, several actual ELF binary files were
  collected and placed in the ~test/samples~ directory:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ ls test/samples
   empty.txt
   fibonacci.c
   fibonacci
   foo.tar
   hello.c
   hello
   ls.c
   ls
   tmux.c
   tmux
   $
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that there are a couple of non-ELF files in there as well, to
   verify the errors generated by our library when given

   The actual outputs aren't known yet, but tasty-sugar can help with
   that.  Setup the tasty-sugar CUBE configuration as follows:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = "test/samples"
                 , rootName = "*.c"
                 , expectedSuffix = "exp"
                 , associatedNames = [ ("binary", "") ]
                 }
   main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube
             defaultMain $ testGroup "elf" $
             withSugarGroups testSweets testGroup $
             \sweets expIdx expectation ->
               testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> " #" <> show expIdx) $ do
                 let Just binaryName = lookup "binary" $ associated expectation
                 r <- runTestOn binaryName
                 e <- readFile $ expectedFile expectation
                 r @?= e

   runTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String
   runTestOn f = ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The tasty-sugar framework does not provide the actual testing: that
   is still provided by the developer.  Instead, the tasty-sugar
   framework reads the contents of the ~test/samples~ directory and
   analyses the available files to create a list of tests that should
   be run.  The tasty-sugar package also provides a function that can
   organize the tests and invoke the user's test function once for
   each test configuration.

   If the tests are run at this point, the tasty-sugar framework will
   do nothing.

   Why?

   The tasty-sugar framework will ignore any files in the target
   directory that do not have an associated expected file describing
   the expected output.  This can be confirmed by running the tests
   with the ~--showsearch~ argument, which will use an alternate tasty
   ingredient that does not actually run the tests but write out the
   search process and search results.

   To get actual tests to run, simply create an expected file for each
   of the input candidates.  The contents of the file can be empty, or
   any random data.

   Running the tests now will result in a test created for each input
   file that has a corresponding ~*.exp~ file.  Note that tasty-sweet
   doesn't actually read in any of the files, just invokes the test
   creation function with the Sweets and Expectation data structures
   that let the test do whatever is appropriate.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ ls test/samples
   empty.txt
   empty.txt.exp
   fibonacci
   finonacci.c
   fibonacci.exp
   foo.tar
   foo.tar.exp
   hello
   hello.c
   hello.exp
   ls
   ls.c
   ls.exp
   tmux
   tmux.c
   $
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that ~empty.txt~ and ~foo.tar~ will be ignored, even though
   there is an ~.exp~ file for them because they don't match the
   source target of ~*.c~.  Similarly, ~tmux~ will be ignored because
   there is no ~.exp~ file for it.

   At this point, any changes to the target library that cause output
   changes will be identified when running the tests.

** Single Input and Output per Test

  * Scenario :: Similar to the previous scenario, but there is a file
                containing the expected input needed by the test to
                generate the output.

  To extend the previous example, let us assume that in addition to
  the pre-existing binaries that we will be generating a number of
  "interesting" binaries to run the target library on.  These will be
  kept in a different directory where a different part of the build
  will compile the sources to generate the binaries for testing:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls test/src_samples
  foo.c
  foo
  foo.expct
  simple.c
  simple
  simple.expct
  recursive.rs
  recursive
  recursive.expct
  functional.hs
  functional
  functional.expct
  $
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Note that there are several different source types (C, Rust,
  Haskell) involved, but each of them has an associated output binary
  that the target library should be tested on.

  In an initial approach, the source files can be ignored by the
  testing code: simply create a ~FILE.expct~ file for each of the
  binaries and use the same ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~ configuration for this
  directory as for the previous directory.

  However however an approach where the actual test written by the
  user needs access to the source file itself for some reason.  This
  can be handled by specifying an "associated" file in the
  ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~ configuration:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = "test/samples"
                 , rootName = "*.exe"
                 , expectedSuffix = "expct"
                 , associatedNames = [ ("c-source", ".c")
                                     , ("rust-source", ".rs")
                                     , ("haskell", ".hs)
                                     ]
                 }

   ingredients = includingOptions sugarOptions :
                 sugarIngredients cube <> defaultIngredients

   main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube
             defaultMainWithIngredients ingredients $
             testGroup "elf" $
             withSugarGroups testSweets testGroup $
             \sweets expIdx expectation ->
               testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> " #" <> show expIdx) $ do
                 e <- readFile $ expectedFile expectation
                 let assoc = associated expectation
                     f = rootFile sweets
                 r <- case lookup "c-source" assoc of
                        Just c -> runCTestOn f
                        Nothing ->
                          case lookup "rust-source" assoc of
                            Just r -> runRustTestOn f
                            Nothing ->
                              runHaskellTestOn f
                 r @?= e

   runCTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String
   runCTestOn f = ...

   runRustTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String
   runRustTestOn f = ...

   runHaskellTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String
   runHaskellTestOn f = ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  Now when tasty-sugar generates the test configurations, each test
  will have a name, a source file, an expected file, and a single
  associated file.  The test is free to use these files in any way it
  sees fit.  For the configuration above, there would be 4 test
  configurations provided to the test:

  | Test Name  | Input File | Expected File    | Associated Files                |
  |------------+------------+------------------+---------------------------------|
  | simple     | simple     | simple.expct     | ("c-source", "simple.c")        |
  | foo        | foo        | foo.expct        | ("c-source", "foo.c")           |
  | recursive  | recursive  | recursive.expct  | ("rust-source", "recursive.rs") |
  | functional | functional | functional.expct | ("haskell", "functional.hs")    |

  Note that if both "simple.c" and "simple.hs" files existed, then the
  simple test configuration would get both as associated files.

** Single Input with different parameters producing different outputs

  * Scenario :: For each input file, multiple tests should be run,
                each with different parameters, and the expected
                output may or may not depend on the parameter.

  Using the previous example scenario, let's now assume that for each
  of the source sample files, two different executables were built:
  one with and one without optimization.  Additionally, if they were a
  C source file, then there was a version built with GCC and a version
  built with Clang.  The output executables are now named accordingly:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls test/src_samples
  foo.c
  foo.noopt.clang.exe
  foo.O0.gcc.exe
  foo.opt.clang.exe
  foo.O2.gcc.exe
  foo.O3.gcc.exe
  simple.c
  simple.noopt.clang.exe
  simple.noopt.gcc.exe
  simple.opt-clang.exe
  simple-opt.gcc-exe
  recursive.rs
  recursive.noopt.exe
  recursive.opt.exe
  functional.hs
  functional.noopt.exe
  functional.opt.exe
  $
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  While the filenames are fairly regular, there are different numbers
  of executables and different naming conventions for different files.

  The opt/noopt/O0/O2/O3 and gcc/clang information is known to
  tasty-sugar as a "parameter".  Parameters can appear in the filename
  in a specific order, and each parameter may have one of a set of
  valid values (e.g. gcc or clang) or it may have any (free-form)
  value (as with the optimization specification).

  The ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~ confguration for is scenario is updated to:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = "test/samples"
                 , rootName = "*"
                 , separators = "-."
                 , expectedSuffix = "expct"
                 , associatedNames = [ ("c-source", ".c")
                                     , ("rust-source", ".rs")
                                     , ("haskell", ".hs")
                                     ]
                 , validParams = [
                    ("optimization", Nothing)
                   ,("c-compiler", Just ["gcc", "clang"])
                   ]
                 }

   ingredients = includingOptions sugarOptions :
                 sugarIngredients cube <> defaultIngredients

   main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube
             defaultMainWithIngredients ingredients $
             testGroup "elf" $
             withSugarGroups testSweets testGroup $
             \sweets expIdx expectation ->
               testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> " #" <> show expIdx) $ do
                 e <- readFile $ expectedFile expectation
                 let assoc = associated expectation
                     f = rootFile sweets
                 r <- case lookup "c-source" assoc of
                        Just c -> runCTestOn f
                        Nothing ->
                          case lookup "rust-source" assoc of
                            Just r -> runRustTestOn f
                            Nothing ->
                              runHaskellTestOn f
                 r @?= e

   runCTestOn :: FilePath -> String
   runCTestOn f = ...

   runRustTestOn :: FilePath -> String
   runRustTestOn f = ...

   runHaskellTestOn :: FilePath -> String
   runHaskellTestOn f = ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  Parameters are separated by designated separator characters and must
  appear in the order declared.  The default separators are "." and
  "-" (e.g. both of the two optimized executable files for the
  simple.c source above are accepted).  

  Filenames may omit later parameter values: the file is assumed to
  apply to all unspecified parameter values if there is no more
  specific override.  This can be very useful to avoid repetition and
  copying when specifying test files.  

  In the above example, a ~simple.expected~ file would be used for all
  four executables, but if there was also a
  ~simple.noopt-gcc.expected~ and a ~simple-opt.expected~ then the
  former would be used only for the ~simple.noopt.gcc.exe~ and the
  latter would be used for both the ~gcc~ and the ~clang~ executables,
  leaving the ~sample.expected~ to be used only for the
  ~simple.opt-clang.exe~ file.

# ** Multiple Inputs with different parameters producing different outputs
# 
#     KWQ...

* Comparisons

** tasty-KAT

  * The tasty-KAT package reads both the inputs and the outputs from a
    single file, instaed of allowing the inputs to be a separate file
    that can be processed by the target under test.

    + The tasty-sugar package allows inputs and outputs to be in
      separate files, and additional "associated" files to be provided
      as inputs to the test.

  * The tasty-KAT package inputs and outputs must be specifiable in a
    file with other KAT markup; this does not easily handle text
    markup conflicts and binary inputs/outputs.

    + The tasty-sugar package does not attempt to interpret the
      contents of the files, but simply passes them to the test
      itself.

  * The tasty-KAT package does not allow auxiliary files, or different
    parameterized tests.

    + As mentioned above, tasty-sugar allows multiple auxiliary files
      per tests, and allows test inputs and expected outputs to be
      filename parameterized (with either constrained or free-form
      parameter values).

** tasty-golden

  * The tasty-golden package requires a 1:1 association between tests
    and corresponding golden expected output files; it does not
    support file-provided inputs, or associated files.

    + The tasty-sugar package allows multiple associated files in
      addition to the primary input file.

    + The tasty-sugar package supports parameterization of expected
      results (and associated files) as part of the filenames to allow
      multiple tests per input.

  * The tasty-golden package will write the expected results if the
    expected file is missing.

    + The tasty-sugar package will write the actual output to a
      *separate* file, but it will not overwrite or assume
      expectations.  This allows the user to validate the output
      before declaring it to be the proper expected value (simply by
      copying the actual output file to the expected output file).
  
** tasty-silver

  Similar to tasty-golden in functionality.

** Features unique to tasty-sugar

  * Multiple potential outputs, parameterized by filename elements.

  * Multiple associated input files.

  * Search analysis mode showing how tests are generated based on the
    available files.

  * Automatic grouping of generated tests by parameter values.

* Limitations

  * Huge directories
  * Huge files
  * Will throw any exception that the listDirectory function can throw.

  :ID:       de026768-f805-4d30-8299-522cdd70926b
  :END:

** Requirements

  * There must be a root (input) file to feed to the test

  * There must be one or more "expected" results files for a root file

  * There may be associated files for the root file required for the test

  * All three groups of files may be parameterized by additional fields.

  * All fields are represented by a common basename with optional
    parameters and required associated suffixes, separated by
    allowable separators.

  All of the above may utilize globbing as provided by System.FilePath.Glob

* Examples

** Example:

 For example, a test which would verify that the size of a compiled
 file meets the expectations would specify:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 CUBE =
   { inputDir = "tests/samples"  -- relative to cabal file
   , separators = ".-"
   , rootName = "*.c"
   , associatedNames = [ ("exe", "exe")
                       , ("object", "o")
                       ]
   , expectedSuffix = "expected"
   , validParams = [ ("arch" : Just ["ppc", "x86_64"]) ]
   }
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 And given the following directory configuration:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 tests/samples/
    foo.c
    bar.c
    bar.exe
    bar.ppc.exe
    bar.expected
    cow.c
    cow.ppc.exe
    cow.x86_64.exe
    cow.expected
    cow.ppc-expected
    cow.x86.expected
    moo.c
    moo.exe
    moo-expected
    dog.exe
    dog.expected
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 The result would be:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 sweets =
   [ Sweets
     { rootMatchName = "bar"
     , rootBaseName = "bar"
     , rootFile = "tests/samples/bar.c"
     , expected =
         [ Expectation
           { expectedFile = "tests/samples/bar.expected"
           , associated = [ ("exe", "tests/samples/bar.exe") ]
           , expParamsMatch = []
           }
         , Expectation
           { expectedFile = "tests/samples/bar.expected"
           , associated = [ ("exe", "tests/samples/bar.ppc.exe") ]
           , expParamsMatch = [ ("arch", "ppc") ]
           }
         ]
     },

           { expectedFile = "tests/samples/cow.ppc-expected"
           , associated = [ ("exe", "tests/samples/cow.ppc.exe") ]
           , expParamsMatch = [ { "arch", "ppc" } ]

           , expParamsMatch = [ ("arch", "x86_64") ]
           }
         ]
     },
   , Sweets
     { rootMatchName = "moo"
     , rootBaseName = "moo"

     , expected =
         [ Expectation
           { expectedFile = "tests/samples/moo-expected"
           , associated = [ ("exe", "tests/samples/moo.exe") ]
           , expParamsMatch = []
           }
         ]
     },
 #+END_EXAMPLE

* FAQ

  Why do the configurations need to be described by a ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~
  data object?  Why can't they be passed in on the command-line?

  * Answer :: They could be, but there are a couple of issues that
              would make that more awkward:

              1. There would need to be a number of command-line
                 arguments to describe all of the CUBE information.

              2. The tasty framework provides command-line parsing and
                 argument handling (and expects to do so).  Handling
                 some command-line arguments prior to tasty and some
                 within tasty would be difficult and brittle (and also
                 note that the set of all tests must be known *prior*
                 to invoking the tasty main code; they cannot be added
                 dynamically after that point).
